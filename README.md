# 📚 Book Recommendation System

This is a frontend web application built with **Next.js**, designed to provide personalized book recommendations using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**. The model leverages book metadata scraped from the [Best Books Ever list on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1.Best_Books_Ever).

> ⚠️ Note: This project primarily focuses on the **recommendation feature**. Other functionalities such as search and navigation may be partially implemented or contain known issues.

## 🧠 Project Overview

### 🔍 Data Source
- Scraped from: [Goodreads - Best Books Ever](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1.Best_Books_Ever)
- Collected data includes: Book titles, authors, genres, ratings, and descriptions.

### 📈 Recommendation Model
- The **TF-IDF** algorithm is used to compute similarity between books based on textual metadata such as descriptions.
- Recommendations are served through a REST API or loaded from local JSON files.
- 👉 For full details on the recommendation model, visit the [Backend Repository](https://github.com/chestharas/book_recommendation_api).

### 🎯 Frontend Objective
- Provide a clean, responsive user interface focused solely on delivering book recommendations.
- Users can select or input a book title to receive a list of similar books.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

* 🔍 **Search functionality** may be incomplete or inconsistent.
* 🧭 **Navigation and filters** are under development or not fully functional.
* 🔌 Backend API (if applicable) should be running in parallel for dynamic data.
